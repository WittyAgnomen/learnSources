Mikelle Ackerley,8/15/18,blaze,Trump directly addresses Omarosa’s worst allegation against him – here’s what he said,"President <bs>Donald Trump<bs> was accused by his former White House aide and “The Apprentice” contestant Omarosa Manigault of using a horribly racist word, and <s>he<s> directly addressed the claim on Monday.
“She made it up”
In a pair of tweets from his official social media account, the <bs>president<bs> denied the claim from Manigault that <s>he<s> had used the “n-word,” and that there was an audio tape of him doing so.
<s>He<s> said that he had a conversation with television producer Mark Burnett, who told him no such tape existed.
“[Mark Burnett] called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa,” <s>he<s> tweeted.
“I don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have,” <s>he<s> added. “She made it up.”
“Look at her MANY recent quotes saying,” <s>he<s> added in a second tweet, “such wonderful and powerful things about me – a true Champion of Civil Rights – until she got fired.”



.@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa. I don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have. She made it up. Look at her MANY recent quotes saying....



....such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true Champion of Civil Rights - until she got fired. Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media (they didn’t want interviews) when she worked in the White House. Now that she says bad about me, they will talk to her. Fake News!

 “Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media (they didn’t want interviews) when she worked in the White House,” <s>he<s> continued. “Now that she says bad about me, they will talk to her. Fake News!”
Trump was referring to Manigault’s statements defending him against charges of racism before the 2016 election and after she joined his administration.
The alleged tape figures a central role in Manigault’s book, where she says that she sought to uncover the evidence of racism until she was fired by White House chief of staff John Kelly. She recorded the conversation when she was fired and subsequently released that audio recording.
<bs>Trump<bs> had attacked Manigault’s credibility earlier on Monday, saying that she begged him for a job at the White House after she had been a contestant at “The Apprentice” without winning three times. “She was vicious, but not smart,” <s>he<s> tweeted.



While I know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!

In interviews Monday, <b>Manigault<b> claimed she had other recordings from her time at the White House and that she was willing to share them with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference and alleged collusion with the Trump campaign"
